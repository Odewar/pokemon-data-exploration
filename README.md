# Pok√©mon Data Analysis üß™

This is a simple project where I used Python and pandas to explore a Pok√©mon dataset. The goal was to practice core programming concepts like lists, booleans, sets, dictionaries, and tuples ‚Äî all using real data.

## What I did

- Loaded and explored the Pok√©mon dataset
- Pulled out useful info like names, types, and stats
- Used basic filtering: 
  - Water-type Pok√©mon
  - Pok√©mon with high HP or strong attacks
- Practiced compound structures (e.g. sets to get unique types, dictionaries for name-to-attack mappings, tuples for stat groupings)
- Found the strongest and weakest Pok√©mon based on stats

## Files

- `pokemon_analysis.py` ‚Äî the main analysis script
- `pokemon_data.csv` ‚Äî the dataset I used (from Kaggle)

## Sample output

```python
Water Pok√©mon: ['Squirtle', 'Psyduck', 'Poliwag', 'Tentacool', 'Slowpoke']
Strongest Pok√©mon by Attack: Mega Mewtwo X
Most Common Type 1: Water
Fire-type Pok√©mon: 7.75%
